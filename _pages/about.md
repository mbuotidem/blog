I'm a software engineer who loves working with cloud applications. In my current role, 
I am spending a lot of time in the AWS ecosystem building serverless backends with Python. In the past, I have worked with C#, the Microsoft stack, and Azure, doing everything from developing web applications to chatbots. I am most comfortable working in Python, C# and JavaScript on both AWS and Azure.
